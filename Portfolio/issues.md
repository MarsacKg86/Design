-Contrast Checker needs at least a 7 to pass- that darn yellow 
in my palette is barely a 2.
-Run site against the Audit on Chrome. Then fix those issues.
-.signature needs to be centered to fit at full screen and mobile
-.blogbutton is now wonky- the text in the box is left aligned for some reason after I added display:flex to the button in CSS.
got to figure out how to make it go back to looking like the .resumebutton on index.html
-kinda want to make the links in the header bigger, but maybe changing the color will make it stand out more.
